A performant and flexible standalone "third-eye" targeting resource, with additional functionality for supported frameworks.

ox_target is the successor to qtarget, which was a mostly-compatible fork of bt-target.
To improve many design flaws, ox_target has been written from scratch and drops support for bt-target/qtarget.qb-target standards, though partial compatibility is being implemented where possible.

## âœ¨ Features

- Improved entity and world collision than its predecessor.
- Improved error handling when running external code.
- Menus for nested target options.
- Partial compatibility for qtarget/qb-target (the thing qb-target is based on, I made the original idiots).

- Groups and items checking for supported frameworks.

## Important

- This resource can't work with scripts like qb-taxijob, that try spawning npcs with a target resource.
